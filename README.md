#### A mock storefront, (not to be confused with Amazon) for buying products using the command line prompt.

The customer storefront (use node bamazonCustomer.js) starts you off by listing all the products available for sale, including prices and quantites available:

Using the item ID and the quantity you wish to purchanse, the storefront will tally-up the price and confirm your order is correct:

This storefront then processes your order, and automatically updates the quantities of items as the customer shop.  After this, it will inquire as to whether you wish to purchanse another item and display the updated product list:

#### _Future updates:_
  * _Give error when quatities are 0 or negative when ordering_
  * _Add manager application to be able to go in and update quantities, etc._
  * _Add supervisor application to go in to add sale prices, see profits, etc._
